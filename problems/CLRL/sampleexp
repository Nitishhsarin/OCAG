The first person that Chef asked has a rating of 600, which is more than 200 so he tells Chef to go to his left. The second person Chef meets has a rating of 300, also tells Chef to go to the left. The third person that chef asked has a rating of 100 so he tells Chef to go to the right. Then Chef asked a person with rating 350, that means Chef went beyond the person with rating of 300, which should never happen, so Chef must have made a mistake while writing this sequence.
